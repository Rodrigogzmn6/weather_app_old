# Weather App

A weather app created with Flutter

## Getting Started

This project was made with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), retrieving data from the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). With this app, you can check the weather and forecast based on your location or search for a specific city, and you can also change between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

## How to use

Once you enter the application, you'll find the expected weather for the day in your location:

<img src="screenshots/Screenshot_summary.png" alt="Main Screen" width="300" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"/>

If you scroll down, you can see the forecast for the next 5 days, with the general weather, maximum and minimum temperatures:

<img src="screenshots/Screenshot_forecast.png" alt="Main Screen" width="300" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"/>

And at the bottom, you'll see the highlights of the current weather, such as wind speed and direction, humidity, pressure, and visibility:

<img src="screenshots/Screenshot_highlights.png" alt="Main Screen" width="300" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"/>

At the top is the search button, where you can search for any city you want to:
